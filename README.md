# Udacity Animal Trading Card
This project was submitted to Udacity during the Intro to Programming Nanodegree course. The project instructions asked for an animal trading card, styled as close as possible to Udacity's prototype, using HTML and CSS. I went with a Shiba Inu in honor of my dog Snickers, who passed away in 2021 at the ripe old age of 17.
