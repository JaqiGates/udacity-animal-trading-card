			<p>Shibas have existed since 300 b.c. They are the most popular breed in Japan.
				This breed is extremely intellegent and stubborn. While training, you can expect
				them to learn quickly, but they will often require treats as payment for good behavior.
				Shibas are very loyal and confident. They are great companion dogs. Socialize your Shiba
				and they will be the best dog you could ask for.
